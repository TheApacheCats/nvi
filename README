This is the new version of ex/vi, which will be distributed as "nvi"
in 4.4BSD.  This software is currently being distributed for test and
review ONLY, and may not be redistributed by anyone for any purpose
whatsoever.  This software will be made freely redistributable by when
.4BSD is released, if not sooner.

This software is derived from software contributed to UC Berkeley by
Steve Kirkendall, the author of elvis.  Without his original work,
this work would have been much more difficult.
