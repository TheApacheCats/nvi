This work is copyrighted by The Regents of the University of California,
Keith Bostic, and others.  This file contains the nvi license.  In short,
the information that it is intended to convey is as follows:

Your use of nvi is subject to the terms of a license from Keith Bostic.
That license provides that:

1. You can use and modify nvi in any way that you want.

2. You can redistribute nvi with or without modifications, in any way you
   want, as long as you don't charge for it.

3. If you want to charge for nvi or any collection of software that includes
   nvi, you may need a distribution license from Keith Bostic.  There are
   specific exceptions, however.  For example, you can include nvi on a CDROM
   of freely redistributable software for which you charge, without having to
   obtain the distribution license.  But if you do expect to charge others,
   you need to review the nvi "use" license below to determine whether any of
   the exceptions apply to you.

   If your intended use requires a distribution license, please contact:

NVI "USE" LICENSE

This License applies to the computer program known as "nvi".  The "Program",
below, refers to such program, and a "work based on the Program" means either
the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United
States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.  The
Program is a copyrighted work owned by Keith Bostic (the "Licensor") and others.

BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM),
YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE,
INCLUDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE
PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT.  NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU
PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS.  IF
YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE
THE PROGRAM.

1. Licenses.

Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply
with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided,
further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the
Program:

(a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the
    Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in
    any medium.

(b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
    distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

2. Restrictions.

This license and your use of the Program is subject to the following
restrictions:

(a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by an
    organization to any third party requires a distribution license if
    any payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether
    directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as
    in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment for
    some product or service that includes a copy of the Program "without
    charge"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration
    of activities requiring a distribution license).  However, the
    following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and
    of themselves require a distribution license:

     (i) Posting the Program or work based on the Program on a public
	 access information storage and retrieval service for which a
	 fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line
	 service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e.,
	 the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of
	 information consisting of random data).

    (ii) Distributing the Program or work based on the Program on a
	 CD-ROM, provided that the files containing the Program or work
	 based on the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such
	 CD-ROM, and provided further that all information on such CD-ROM
	 be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge.

(b) Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the
    Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its
    scope.  Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted,
    and any output produced through the use of the Program is subject to
    this license only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).

(c) You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to the
    distribution of any work based on the Program:

      (i) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
	  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
	  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all
	  third parties.

     (ii) You must make the complete corresponding machine-readable source
	  code available on request for any such work based on the Program.

    (iii) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's
	  exercise of the rights granted herein.

3. Reservation of Rights.

No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

4. Other Restrictions.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution
is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case,
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

5.	Limitations.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY.  THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

6.	General.  

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A.,
excluding choice of law rules.

For government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  Use,
duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions as
set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of The Rights in Technical Data and
Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 or subparagraphs (c)(1) and
(2) of the Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights 48 CFR 52.227-19,
as appropriate.

If you distribute the Program to others, you must comply with the laws
and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions regarding
export control.  You must not export or reexport the Program without
obtaining all required licenses and authorizations of the export control
agencies of the applicable governments.
