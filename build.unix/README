Vi uses the GNU autoconf program for configuration and compilation.
You should enter:

	./configure<carriage-return>
	make<carriage-return>

and vi should configure the system and build two binaries, named
"ex" and "vi" for you.

If you've want to rebuild vi, for example, you change your mind about
what curses library implementation that you want to use, enter:

	make distclean<carriage-return>

and then follow the above instructions.

There is only one part of vi's configuration that is interactive:
selecting the curses library that you want to use.

Where possible, vi uses the local curses library.  The problem is that
there are lots of systems where the local curses library is sufficiently
broken that it cannot support vi.  Symptoms of curses implementations
that can't handle vi include:

	+ Core dumps in curses routines.
	+ Line-by-line screen repainting instead of scrolling.
	+ Missing routines when compiling.
	+ Repainting the wrong characters on the screen.
	+ Displaying inverse video in the wrong places.

If you see any of the above symptoms, then you should find another curses
library to use.  There are three alternatives:

    #1: Compile the 4BSD curses library from any of the recent BSD
	releases: FreeBSD, NetBSD or 4.4BSD-Lite release 2.  These
	libraries should be able to support vi.

    #2: Compile the curses library included with vi (in ../curses).
	This is a stripped-down copy of the 4.4BSD-Lite2 curses library.

    #3: Retrieve and build the ncurses library.  This library is not
	really recommended, at least for now, for two reasons.  First, it
	can't be built on any system where the compiler doesn't support
	function prototypes.  Second, it currently has a few bugs in its
	support for vi.  It mostly works, but it's still not quite right.

When you enter "./configure" for the FIRST time, you will be prompted:

	Do you want to use the system curses library? (y/n)

If you enter yes<carriage-return>, then vi will compile using the loader
option -lcurses to find the curses library, and will assume that the
curses include file <curses.h> will be found by the compiler without any
additional action on vi's part.

If you enter anything other than yes, then you will be prompted:

	Do you want to use the vi supplied curses library? (y/n)

If you enter yes<carriage-return>, then vi will compile using the curses
source code supplied with the vi distribution.  

If you enter anything other than yes, then you will be prompted:

	Type in the pathname of the curses library:

You should enter the path of the curses library you want to use,
e.g., "/usr/lib/libcurses.a".  You will then be prompted:

	Type in the pathname of the directory holding <curses.h>:

You should enter the path of the directory where the compiler can
find the <curses.h> include file, e.g., "/usr/include".
