.Sh VI COMMANDS
#ifdef REFERENCE
When
.Nm \&vi
is executed,
the text of a file is read (or a temporary file is created),
and then all editing changes happen to a copy of the file.
No changes effect the file until the file is written out,
either using a write command or based on the value of the
.Sy autowrite
option.
.Pp
Lines on the screen that come after the end of the file are displayed
as containing a single <tilde> (``~'') character.
Empty lines do not have any special representation.
To differentiate between empty lines and lines consisting of only
whitespace characters, use the
.Sy list
option.
Historically, implementations of
.Nm \&vi
have also displayed some lines as single <asterisk> (``@'') characters.
These were lines that were not correctly displayed, i.e. lines on the
screen that did not correspond to lines in the file.
.Nm \&Nvi
does not display lines in this fashion.
.Pp
The bottom line of the screen is used to enter
.Nm \&ex
commands, and for
.Nm \&vi
error and informational messages.
.Pp
.Nm \&Vi
is a modeful editor, i.e. it has two modes,
.Dq command
and
.Dq "text input" .
When
.Nm \&vi
first starts, it is in command mode.
There are several commands that change
.Nm \&vi
into text input mode.
Generally, in input mode, the <escape> character is used to exit
back into command mode.
In
.Nm \&vi
command mode, the cursor is always positioned on the last column of
characters which take up more than one column on the screen.
In
.Nm \&vi
text insert mode, the cursor is positioned on the first column of
characters which take up more than one column on the screen.
.Pp
Each
.Nm \&vi
command described below notes where the cursor ends up after it is
executed.
This position is described in terms of characters on the line, i.e.
.Dq "the previous character" ,
or,
.Dq "the last character in the line" .
This is to avoid needing to continually refer to on what part of the
character the cursor rests.
.Pp
Generally, if the cursor line and cursor column are not on the screen,
then the screen is scrolled (if the target cursor is close) or repainted
(if the target cursor is far away) so that the cursor is on the screen.
If the screen is scrolled, it is moved a minimal amount, and the cursor
line will usually appear at the top or bottom of the screen.
In the screen is repainted, the cursor line will appear in the center of
the screen, unless the cursor is sufficiently close to the beginning or
end of the file that this isn't possible.
If the
.Sy leftright
option is set, the screen may be scrolled or repainted in a horizontal
direction as well as in a vertical one.
.Pp
.Nm \&Vi
keeps track of the currently
.Dq most attractive
cursor position.
Each command description (for commands that can change the current
cursor position),
specifies if the cursor is set to a specific location in the line,
or if it is moved to the most attractive cursor position.
The latter means that the cursor is moved to the cursor position that
is vertically as close as possible to the last cursor position.
If the current line is shorter than than the cursor position
.Nm \&vi
would select, the cursor is positioned on the last character in the line.
In all cases, if the line is empty, the cursor is positioned on the first
column of the line.
If a command moves the cursor to the most attractive position, it does
not alter that position.
Therefore, although a movement to a line shorter than the currently
most attractive position will cause the cursor to move to the end of
that line, a subsequent movement to a longer line will cause the
cursor to move back to the most attractive position.
.Pp
The following words have special meaning in this description.
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX" -compact
.It Li "current pathname"
The pathname of the file currently being edited by vi.
When the character
.Dq Li \&%
appears in a pathname entered as part of an
.Nm \&ex
command argument, it's replaced by the current pathname.
The
.Dq Li \&%
character can be escaped by preceding it with a backslash.
.It Li "alternate pathname"
The name of the last file mentioned in an
.Nm \&ex
command, or, the previous current pathname if the last file mentioned
becomes the current file.
When the character
.Dq Li \&#
appears in a pathname entered as part of an
.Nm \&ex
command argument, it's replaced by the alternate pathname.
The
.Dq Li \&#
character can be escaped by preceding it with a backslash.
.It Li "buffer"
One of a number of named areas for saving copies of text.
Commands that change or delete text can save the changed or deleted
text into a specific buffer, for later use.
Buffers are named with a single character, preceded by a double quote,
e.g.
.Dq Li "<character> .
Historic implementations of
.Nm \&vi
have limited <character> to one of the lower-case alphabetic characters
or a number.
.Nm \&Nvi
permits the use of any character.
.Pp
The buffers named by uppercase characters are the same as buffers
named by the lowercase characters, e.g. using the buffer named by
the English character
.Dq Li \&A
is the same as using the buffer named
.Dq Li \&a ,
with the single exception that, if the buffer contents are being
changed (as with a text deletion or copying command), the text is
.Em appended
to the buffer, instead of replacing the current contents.
.Pp
The buffers named by the numeric characters (in English,
.Dq \&1
through
.Dq \&9 ),
are special, in that if at least one line is changed or deleted in
the file,
(or the change or delete crosses a line boundary) a copy of the text
is always placed into the numeric buffer
.Dq \&1 ,
regardless of the user also specifying another buffer in which to
store it.
Before this copy is done, the previous contents of buffer
.Dq \&1
are moved into buffer
.Dq \&2 ,
.Dq \&2
into buffer
.Dq \&3 ,
and so on.
Text may be explicitly stored or appended into the numeric buffers.
In this case, the buffer rotation described above occurs before the
replacement of (or appending to) the buffer's contents.
.Pp
When a
.Nm \&vi
command synopsis shows both a
.Dq Li [buffer]
and
.Dq Li [count] ,
they may be presented in any order.
.It Li "unnamed buffer"
The unnamed buffer is a text storage area which is used by commands
that take a buffer as an argument when no specific buffer is specified.
.It Li "count"
A positive number used as an optional argument to most commands,
either to give a size or a position (for display or movement commands),
or as a repeat count (for commands that modify text).
The count argument is always optional and defaults to 1 unless otherwise
noted in the command description.
.Pp
When a
.Nm \&vi
command synopsis shows both a
.Dq Li [buffer]
and
.Dq Li [count] ,
they may be presented in any order.
.It Li "motion"
A
.Nm \&vi
motion command used as an optional trailing argument to some commands,
indicating the extent of the text that's affected by the command.
The motion argument can be either the command character repeated (in
which case it means the current line) or a cursor movement command.
In the latter case, the region affected by the command is from the
starting or stopping cursor position which comes first in the file,
to just before the starting or stopping cursor position which comes
later in the file.
Commands that operate on lines instead of beginning and ending cursor
positions operate on all of the lines that are wholly or partially
in the region.
.Pp
The following may all be used as motion components for other
.Nm \&vi
commands:
.sp
.TS
r r r r.
<control-B>	<control-D>	<control-F>	<control-H>
<control-J>	<control-M>	<control-N>	<control-P>
<control-U>	<space>,	$	%
'<character>	(	)	,
-	/	0	;
?	B	E	F
G	L	M	N
T	W	[[	]]
^	`<character>	b	e
f	j	k	l
n	t	w	{
|	}
.TE
.Pp
The optional count prefix available for some of the
.Nm \&vi
commands that take motion commands, or the count prefix available
for the
.Nm \&vi
commands that are used as motion components,
may be included and is
.Em always
considered part of the motion argument.
For example, the commands
.Dq Li c2w
and
.Dq Li 2cw
are equivalent, and the region affected by the
.Sy c
command is two words of text.
In addition, if the optional count prefix is specified for both the
.Nm \&vi
command and its motion component, the effect is multiplicative and
is considered part of the motion argument.
For example, the commands
.Dq Li 4cw
and
.Dq Li 2c2w
are equivalent, and the region affected by the
.Sy c
command is four words of text.
.It Li "previous context"
The position of the cursor before the last non-relative motion was
executed.
.It Li "paragraph"
An area of text that begins with either the beginning of a file,
an empty line, or a section boundary, and continues until either
an empty line, section boundary, or the end of the file.
Additional paragraph boundaries can be defined using the
.Sy paragraph
option.
.It Li "section"
An area of text that starts with the beginning of the file or a line
whose first character is either a <form-feed> or an open brace (``{'')
and continues until the next section or the end of the file.
Additional section boundaries can be defined using the
.Sy sections
option.
.It Li "sentence"
An area of text that begins with either the beginning of the file or the
first nonblank character following the previous sentence, paragraph, or
section boundary and continues until the end of the file or a or a period,
exclamation point, or question mark (``.'', ``!'', ``?'') character,
followed by either an end-of-line or two whitespace characters.
Any number of closing parentheses, brackets, or double-quote (``)'',
``]'', ``"'') characters can appear between the period, exclamation point,
or question mark and the whitespace characters or end-of-line.
.It Li "<interrupt>"
The interrupt character is used to interrupt the current operation.
This character is normally <control-C>, however, whatever character
is set for the current terminal session is used.
.It Li "<literal next>"
The literal next character is used to escape the subsequent character
from any special meaning.
This character is normally <control-V>.
If the terminal is not set up to do XON/XOFF flow control,
then <control-Q> may be used as well.
.It Li "bigword"
A set of non-whitespace characters preceded and followed by whitespace
characters or the beginning or end of the file or line.
.It Li "word"
Generally, in languages where it is applicable,
.Nm \&vi
recognizes two kinds of words.
First, a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, delimited at both
ends by: characters other than letters, digits, or underscores; the
beginning or end of a line; the beginning or end of the file.
Second, a sequence of characters other than letters, digits, underscores,
or whitespace characters, delimited at both ends by: a letter, digit,
underscore, or whitespace character;
the beginning or end of a line; the beginning or end of the file.

Reverse character case.
#ifdef REFERENCE
Reverse the case of the count character(s) beginning at the current
cursor position.
Lowercase alphabetic characters shall be changed to uppercase and
uppercase characters changed to lowercase.
Other characters are unaffected.
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX" -compact
.It "Current line:"
If the cursor is on the last character of a line, and there are more
lines in the file, the cursor moves to the next line.
.It "Current column:"
The next character, unless the cursor changes lines, in which case the
cursor moves to the first character of the line.
.It Options:
None.

#endif
.It Li "<interrupt>"
Interrupt the current operation.
#ifdef REFERENCE
Many of the potentially long-running
.Nm \&vi
commands may be interrupted using the terminal interrupt character.
These operations include searches, file reading and writing, filter
operations and map character expansion.
Interrupts are also enabled when running commands outside of
.Nm \&vi .
If the <interrupt> character is used to interrupt entering an
.Nm \&ex
command, the command is aborted, the cursor returns to its previous
position, and
.Nm \&vi
remains in command mode.
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX" -compact
.It "Current line:"
Dependent on the operation being interrupted.
.It "Current column:"
Dependent on the operation being interrupted.
.It Options:
None.

.Pp
The following section describes the commands available in the text
input mode of the
.Nm \&vi
editor.
#ifdef REFERENCE
.Pp
Historically,
.Nm \&vi
implementations only permitted the characters inserted on the current
line to be erased.
In addition, only the
.Dq Li <control-D>
erase character and the
.Dq Li 0<control-D>
and
.Dq Li ^<control-D>
erase strings could erase
.Sy autoindent
characters.
This implementation permits erasure to continue past the beginning
of the current line, and back to where text input mode was entered.
In addition,
.Sy autoindent
characters may be erased using the standard erase characters.
For the line and word erase characters, reaching the
.Sy autoindent
characters forms a
.Dq soft
boundary, denoting the end of the current word or line erase.
Repeating the word or line erase key will erase the
.Sy autoindent
characters.
.Pp
Historically,
.Nm \&vi
always used 
.Dq Li <control-H>
and
.Dq Li <control-W>
as character and word erase characters, respectively, regardless of
the current terminal settings.
This implementation accepts, in addition to these two characters,
the current terminal characters for these operations.
#endif
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX" -compact
.It Li "<control-D>"
#ifdef MANUAL
Erase the previous autoindent character.
#endif
#ifdef REFERENCE
If the previous character on the line was an
.Sy autoindent
character, erase it.
Otherwise, if the user is entering the first character in the line,
.Li <control-D>
is ignored.
Otherwise, a literal
.Li <control-D>
character is entered.
#endif
.It Li "^<control-D>"
#ifdef MANUAL
Erase all of the autoindent characters, and reset the autoindent level.
#endif
#ifdef REFERENCE
If the previous character on the line was an
.Sy autoindent
character, erase all of the
.Sy autoindent
characters on the line.
In addition, the
.Sy autoindent
level is reset to 0.
#endif
.It Li "0<control-D>"
#ifdef MANUAL
Erase all of the autoindent characters.
#endif
#ifdef REFERENCE
If the previous character on the line was an
.Sy autoindent
character, erase all of the
.Sy autoindent
characters on the line.
#endif
.It Li "<control-T>"
Insert sufficient <tab> and <space> characters to move the cursor
forward to a column immediately after a column which is an even
multiple of the
.Sy shiftwidth
option.
#ifdef REFERENCE
.Pp
Historically,
.Nm \&vi
did not permit the
.Li \&^T
command to be used unless the cursor was at the first column of a new
line or it was preceded only by
.Sy autoindent
characters.
.Nm \&Nvi
permits it to be used at any time during insert mode.
#endif
.It Li "<erase>
.It Li "<control-H>"
Erase the last character.
.It Li "<literal next>"
Quote the next character.
The next character will not be mapped or interpreted specially
in any way.
.It Li "<escape>
Resolve all text input into the file, and return to command mode.
.It Li "<line erase>
Erase the current line.
.It Li "<control-W>"
.It Li "<word erase>
Erase the last word.
The definition of word in this case is dependent on the
.Sy altwerase
and
.Sy ttywerase
options.
.It Li "<control-X>[0-9A-Fa-f]*"
Insert a character with the hexadecimal value specified into the text.
.It Li "<interrupt>"
Interrupt text input mode, returning to command mode.
#ifdef REFERENCE
If the <interrupt> character is used to interrupt inserting text
into the file, it is as if the <escape> character was used; all
text input up to the interruption is resolved into the file.
